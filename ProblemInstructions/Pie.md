## Introduction

Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, and Edsger Dijkstra are all sitting around a table, discussing cutting-edge computer science algorithms. Suddenly everyone gets hungry, and they decide to go out and buy a delicious peppermint pie. After returning from the grocery store with their pie, they open the box to find their pie cut into X slices. They realize that once they divide up the slices of pie between the three of them, there might be slices left over. Turing, Lovelace, and Dijkstra are still busy talking, but you can help them by writing a program to determine how many left over slices they will have after dividing the pie amongst themselves.

## Sample Input
There will be multiple lines of input, each containing an integer X, the number of slices the pie has been cut into.

```
6
13
1
23
```

## Sample Output
For each input line, output the number of slices which will have to be wrapped up and put in the fridge for leftovers.
