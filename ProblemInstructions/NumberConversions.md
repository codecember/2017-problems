## Introduction
Turns out there are more than one way to count numbers.

Write a program that accepts Roman numeral numbers and outputs the value in Arabic Numerals. Your program must handle the Roman numeral values `M`, `D`, `C`, `L`, `X`, `V` and `I`, in both upper and lower case. For example: `CMI` is `901` and `MCMXCI` is `1991`. 

## Input
The first line contains \\(N\\), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing a string of roman numeral characters.
