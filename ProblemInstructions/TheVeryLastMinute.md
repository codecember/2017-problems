## Introduction

Whoops! Someone designed this problem at the very last minute. Cutting it close! But how close?

Given a deadline and a starting time, write a program that finds the difference in hours and minutes.

## Input
Input starts with a line containing \\(N\\), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines, one for a deadline and one for a starting time. The deadline will always fall after the starting time. Each line consists of a time-stamp (in military time), and day of the month separated by a space.
