## Introduction

Remember the thing where people think that no two snowflakes are alike? Did you know that's not true? ...No? Well maybe it is, but I'm pretty sure there was someone who found two snowflakes that were exactly the same

Input consists of a string of digits that corresponds to a snowflake pattern. Output the repeated snowflake pattern.

## Input
Input consists of \\(N\\) test cases, where \\(0 \\leq N \\leq 2000\\). Each test case contains one line with a number \\(T\\), where \\(0 \\leq T \\leq 10^{30}\\). The last line of input  contains a `0`, do not process this line
